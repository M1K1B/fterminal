## Reporting a Vulnerability


If you found an issue in our script or script stop working for some reason, you can leave a comment
with a problem in Issues section or simply go on link https://github.com/M1K1B/fterminal/issues

There is no specific time when updates comming, we realising updates when we have a new idea for tools.
If we accept vulnerability you can expect that problem will be solved in 1 or 2 days depends on our time,
we never decline issues exclusively if the problem is nonsense.
